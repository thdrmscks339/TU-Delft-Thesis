# Urban Form and Building Energy Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts used for analyzing the relationship between urban form elements, building characteristics, and energy consumption across different seasons and spatial scales. The scripts cover various stages of the analysis pipeline, including data handling and cleaning, processing the provided dataset, converting land surface temperature (LST) to air temperature, testing with weather sensors, and analyzing the relative importance of urban form elements using the Genizi method. The results of the analysis are presented through a series of visualizations.

The main objective of this project is to understand how urban form and building characteristics influence energy consumption patterns and to identify the most significant factors contributing to energy usage in different seasons and at different spatial scales. The analysis employs a range of techniques, including regression analysis and the Genizi method, to quantify the relative importance of variables such as building volume, height, density, and vegetation index (NDVI).

Please note that some files encountered issues during download and were converted to .txt files. Additionally, a few files are too large to be visualized directly on GitHub. The provided code files can be run using Python 3 and require various libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. To reproduce the analysis, ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and the required dataset is available.

This project serves as a foundation for understanding the complex interactions between urban form, building characteristics, and energy consumption.
